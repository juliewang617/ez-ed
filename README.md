# Ez-Ed

When Kode with Klossy and Deloitte announced its health equity challenge, I was immediately inspired by my experience with eczema to create a website dedicated to its impacts. The more I researched, the more I realized how widespread of an issue A.D. is, and the huge scale of people worldwide who lack access to care to proper eczema care. While I was aware that people of disadvantaged backgrounds generally had a harder time finding treatment, I was unaware of its scale. Through Ez-Ed, I hope to raise awareness of the impact of atopic dermatitis, with a specific lens on the experiences of historically underrepresented groups, like racial minorities and low-income families.
