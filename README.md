# Ez-Ed

As someone who has experienced atopic and seborrheic dermatitis my whole life, I owe a lot to my dermatologist and family for providing the best possible care for me to manage my condition to a stable point.

When Kode with Klossy and Deloitte announced its latest challenge regarding health equity, I was immediately inspired by my experience with eczema to create a website dedicated to its impacts. The more I researched, the more I realized how widespread of an issue A.D. is, and the huge scale of people worldwide who lack access to care to proper eczema care.

Ezcema-Educate (Ez-Ed) aims to spread awareness on the impact of eczema and the widespread disparities in access to care. Moreover, for those with atopic dermatitis, Ez-Ed offers guidance in managing and identifying symptoms to lessen eczemaâ€™s impact on their lives.
